## Have you ever seen a website as cool as this?

I made this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a framework for generating
super cool static sites! I made my own layouts and includes, and now my own pages too!

------------------

## How did I made this site so cool?

This site looks cool thanks to [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and
[Masonstrap](https://srct.gmu.io/masonstrap/)! These CSS/JS frameworks allow me
to make this site look pretty without having to do much work?

## Who is this "SRCT"?

Student-Run Computing and Technology (SRCT, pronounced "circuit") is a student organization at George Mason University which enhances student computing at our school by developing and maintaining systems that provide specific services for Mason's community.

We were founded in 2011 to be a place where students could work together, share their knowledge, and build really neat projects for the benefit of everyone at Mason, as well as run a host of events to help get students involved.
